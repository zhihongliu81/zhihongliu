I am a software engineer with a passion for Python, Javascript, Node.js, React, Redux, Express, Flask, Sequelize and SQLAlchemy. I sucessfully created one app of cloning meetup with JavaScript, express, sequelize for backend and another app of cloning yelp with python, flask and SQLAlchemy for backend, for both projects with React and Redux for frontend. I also Stored image uploads in the cloud with AWS S3, reducing server load and allowing app to scale gracefully.
I love learning new technology and challenging myself to think logically, methodically, and creatively.
